This document inventories API endpoints inferred from PHP files under `api/`. Detailed methods, parameters, and response schemas will be added in a deeper scan.

- service.php _(To be generated)_
- settings.php _(To be generated)_
- statbot.php _(To be generated)_
- users.php _(To be generated)_

## Next Steps

- Identify authentication requirements and error models
- Produce example requests and responses per endpoint
