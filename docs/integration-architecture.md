# Integration Architecture

## Overview
This system consists of two web panels, a backend API, and a bot. Panels and bot communicate with the API over HTTP. Payments and provisioning integrate via PHP scripts and panel flows.

## Parts
- panel (UI)
- webpanel (Admin UI)
- api (Backend)
- vpnbot (Bot)

## Interactions
- panel → api: user operations, orders, invoices, payments
- webpanel → api: admin operations, product/panel management, users
- vpnbot → api: user self-service, status, renewal, verification

## Integration Points (examples)
- Authentication/session handling _(To be generated)_
- Products and plans _(To be generated)_
- Payment initiation and callbacks _(To be generated)_
- Panel provisioning and status _(To be generated)_

## Data Flow
1. UI/Bot collects input
2. Request to API endpoint
3. API performs business logic and persistence
4. Response returned to UI/Bot

## Cross-cutting Concerns
- Error handling and retries _(To be generated)_
- Authentication/authorization _(To be generated)_
- Idempotency for payments _(To be generated)_
- Observability (logging/metrics) _(To be generated)_
